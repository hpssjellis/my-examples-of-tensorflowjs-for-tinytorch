I am going to get some help from the different LLM's each working on it's own version of a on device xiaoML kit weights trainer.

The folder on the sd card will be


/root
/header
------/myModel.h
/images
---/class0/img1 ....
---/class1/img1....
---/class2/img1...

the image numbering is not important.
